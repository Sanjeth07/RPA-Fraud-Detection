# RPA-Fraud-Detection

The growing complexities of state-sponsored terrorism, professional criminals and basement bad guys are becoming harder to understand, follow, expose and prevent. Fraud detection in today’s world involves a comprehensive approach to match data points with activities to find what is abnormal. Fraudsters have developed sophisticated tactics, so it’s essential to stay on top of these changing approaches of gaming the system.

Many times, cybersecurity breaches enable fraudulent activities. Take for example, retail or financial services: Once a luxury, real-time transaction monitoring is now a baseline requirement, not only for financial transactions, but for digital event data surrounding authentication, session, location and device.

(Code 9-11): The finance department noted that some of the fraudulent transactions were recorded as coming from Smokey Bear’s zip code (20252).
You agree this is suspicious, it’s unlikely that the fire prevention mascot is using Reputable Company’s services.
Show the full_names and emails of the transactions listing 20252 as the zip code.

(Code 15-18): Finance has also noticed a number of pseudonyms associated with fraudulent transactions.
The fraudsters thought it would be funny to use ‘Art Vandelay’ for their full name or add a ‘der’ for their middle name.
Use a query to find the names and emails associated with these transactions.

(Code 22-24): There are some irregularities in the IP addresses where transactions are originating from.
For example, any IP address beginning with ‘10.’ is reserved for internal use.
We shouldn’t see IP addresses like this accessing Reputable Company’s service.
Show the ip_addresses and emails listed with these transactions.

(Code 28-30): Users are making fraudulent transactions using a temporary email address service. These services provide a short-lived email that can be verified and then self-destructs.
Show the emails in transaction_data with ‘temp_email.com’ as a domain.

(Code 34-37): The finance department is looking for a specific transaction. 
They know that the transaction occurred from an ip address starting with ‘120.’ and their full name starts with ‘John’. Show the transaction.
